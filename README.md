Problem Statement:

Design a backend system to support a few of the functionalities of a social networking
app. You can design the database models/fields as you seem fit to achieve the functionalities
mentioned below:

1 Users sign up with an email-id, password, username(unique)

2 Users can create a post and publish it on the site. Assume only text based posts can be
put up

3 Users cannot update posts once created, but can only delete them

4 Other users on the site can perform following operations on a post
- Like
- Comment

5 Users visiting the site will see a list of posts by other users sorted by recency


Expectations:

1 Please try to keep modularity, reusability and readability of the code in mind

2 Design the database models/fields considering above requirements

3 Design APIs (endpoint, request/response structures) as you seem fit to achieve the
above mentioned functionalities

4 TDD approach is a massive plus point

5 Share the postman collections file as well while submitting the assignment

6 UI interface is not required

7 Please also mention in case you are taking any assumption


Assumptions:

1. Creating and publishing a post is the same (like in Facebook)
